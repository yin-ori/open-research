# Preliminary Review on Zettlr for Use in Research

## Usage: 
> I have been using Zettlr for a couple of weeks now with main focus on thesis writing and thesis notetaking (but also for project notes e.g.). I used to use **TexShop** and **Scrivener** for those purposes before, thus aiming to reduce the programs I use daily (and simultaneously).

### Environment: 
* Mac M1 (Monterey)
* Zettlr Version 2.2.6

## Design:
+ overall intuitive somewhat customizable design

## Features:
### +
+ all basic features necessary for my research are covered (tagging, frontmatter, comments etc.)
### nice-to-have: 
 * color-coding for text (may not be native but) would be a nice feature for differentiating
 * internal link of headers in a file and across files would also be a helpful feature
 * visualizing quotes ">" as such in the UI
 * an iPad App to facilitate integration
### -
- the "id-search" feature doesn't work for me - after 1 hour I gave up looking into it (there might probably be a solution, but it wasn't worth the time for me when I can also link the filename)
- the search function can get buggy sometimes (not finding anything anymore), restarting will solve the issue usually

## Integrability:
### +
+ "all-in-one" promise largely kept
+ allows Markdown, YAML and LaTeX, among others
+ successfully replaces Scrivener for me for notetaking and working on the dissertation (only process of compilation still via TexShop)
### -
- referencing via Bibtex not (yet) possible - unfortunate for LaTeX users, because I can't use the reference-feature this way. 
- Problems with GoogleDrive Sync (changes via GoogleDrive are laggy and buggy: removing folders doesn't work for Google-Sync files, accepting changes in text from Google-Sync files is a bit bumpy)
â†’ GoogleDrive is clashing with many other apps (especially on Mac). Mindnode shows similar problems here. So in fairness, it's probably more of an issue of GoogleDrive than of Zettlr. However, it can still slow down the active working process.
